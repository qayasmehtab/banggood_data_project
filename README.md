## Featured Project

### 📦 Banggood Product Data Pipeline & Analysis

*A complete, end-to-end data engineering project designed to demonstrate real-world data workflows in a cloud-ready environment.*

This project showcases my practical skills as a **Cloud Data Engineer**, covering the full lifecycle of data handling — from web scraping to analysis and interactive visualization — implemented in a clean, modular, and production-style structure.

---

### 🔍 Project Overview

The pipeline automates a complete data workflow:

**1. Web Scraping**

* Scraped product data from **5 Banggood categories**
* Extracted key attributes:

  * Product Name
  * Price
  * Rating
  * Number of Reviews
  * Product URL

**2. Data Cleaning & Transformation**

* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Converted data types for analysis readiness
* Cleaned price and rating formats
* Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Identified top-rated products
* Analyzed price distribution
* Compared cheapest vs. most expensive products
* Category-level insights based on ratings and reviews

**4. SQL Data Pipeline**

* Stored cleaned datasets in **SQLite**
* Created category-wise tables
* Performed aggregation queries for analytical insights

**5. Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**

* Built an interactive dashboard for product analysis
* Visualizations include:

  * Bar charts
  * Histograms
  * Category-wise comparisons
  * Price vs. rating insights

**How this structure helps:**

* Keeps each step of the pipeline clear and organized
* Makes the code easy to read for reviewers and interviewers
* Allows smooth scaling or future cloud migration (AWS/GCP)
* Follows a real-world, professional data engineering layout
